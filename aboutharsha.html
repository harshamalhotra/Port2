        <h3 class="title-project-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">CURRENTLY, I AM AVAILABLE FOR A FULL TIME POSITION AND A FREELANCE OPPORTUNITY IN THE BAY AREA.</h3>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">My name is Harsha. I like to design stuff. I live in the city of San Francisco but I call many places home. I was born in a small city called Chandigarh in India, which is known for its greenery and butter chicken(a savory dish made with chicken in slightly spiced curry).&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="aboutme-headings main-heading1-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">MY LOVE FOR STORY TELLING</h3>
        <p class="aboutme-para2 desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">From a young age, I loved the art of storytelling. I used to read about characters in history class and visualize the life of the great rulers filled with their struggles and glories. This made me feel the pain they must have felt when a great empire fell down. This created a sense of empathy in me. I loved watching movies and still do.</p>
        <h3 class="aboutme-headings main-heading1-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">DECOMPOSITION OF BIG PROBLEM INTO SMALL ONES</h3>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">I pursued Computer Science Engineering which made me think about complex problems and then dividing into small parts to solve them. The ability of decomposing a big problem and creating solutions for these mini problems has helped me figure out a lot of solutions for various design problems.</p>
        <h3 class="aboutme-headings main-heading1-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">RESEARCH - BACKBONE FOR SUCCESS</h3>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">The next step for my quest for knowledge was to get a degree of M.B.A. in Marketing. I learnt about marketing research and conducted a lot of market research studies. I got a first hand experience to collect raw data through interviews and surveys. Statistics became my friend and I got to know about the various techniques of quantitive and qualitative analysis. My imagination took a physical form and I started sketching and storyboarding my presentations.</p>
        <h3 class="aboutme-headings main-heading1-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">INSPIRATION STRIKES</h3>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">I got a job in a bank in India. My first assignment was to get hold of customers and "teach" them how to use the bank mobile application. I had used the app before and didn't face much problems using it. I started spending time with people and saw how difficult was to to use the app. It was not designed keeping in mind the users and was not usable at all. I started noticing the pain points and &nbsp;this is when the inspiration of designing simple but functional and beautiful solutions struck me.</p>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">Back then, I had no idea that a full area of study exists for designing usable products existed. After getting married, I moved to the Bay area. While I was still figuring out how to cook food, I landed a job at Google's Self Driving Car Project. I designed scenarios the car might face on the road. This helped me develop a holistic way of thinking by incorporating all the possibilities that a product(or car) can run into.</p>
        <p class="desc-text-black-center" data-ix="scroll-up-in-view">My quest for creating good design solutions led me to pursue an intensive UX Design program at Bloc. Here I learnt to use various tools for creating beautiful and functional designs.</p>
